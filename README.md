Everything you need to run the gelatinbrain puzzle simulator

This program is also known as:

- gelatinbrain's Virtual Magic Polyhedra
- permutation puzzle
- permuzzle
- jzzz

See Gelatinbrain's [official website](https://zqjxkvby.com/permuzzle/), which includes the [scoreboard](https://zqjxkvby.com/permuzzle/scoreboard.php).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `run.bat` (Windows) or `run.sh` (macOS/Linux)

## Caveats

- On macOS, the program crashes when loading a new puzzle while one is already open. To work around this, close the program; the script will automatically restart it if you had a puzzle open. To actually close the program, close it from the puzzle selection menu.
- On Linux, the program shows a blank white screen. If anyone knows how to fix this, let us know!
